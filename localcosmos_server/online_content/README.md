# LOCALCOSMOS ONLINE CONTENT (LCOC)
#######################################################################

Provide "Website-like" content that is available in your app instantly.

LCOC interfaces with the app by reading json files of its preview or released version, which consists of files on a hard drive.
These json files provide for example the name of the theme used by an app.
LCOS then looks into the themes folder to find templates that can be used.

LCOS is available in both the AppAdmin and AppKit.
